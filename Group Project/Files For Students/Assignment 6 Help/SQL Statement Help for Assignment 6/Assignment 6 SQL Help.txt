Based on which database you use, here are the connection strings:

ReservationSystem.mdb:
sConnectionString = @"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data source= " + Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() + "\\ReservationSystem.mdb";

ReservationSystem.accdb:
sConnectionString = @"Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=" + Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() + "\\ReservationSystem.accdb";

When running the example program that I have given you, this application shoes all requirements for both part 1 and 2 of assignment 6.  Make sure for Assignment 6 Part 1, you only code those requirements for the first part.

Here are the table and columns for the database.  Columns that are "AutoNumber" don't need to be inserted because they are generated by Access when you insert a new record.

Flight
- Flight_ID - AutoNumber
- Flight_Number - String
- Aircraft_Type - String

Flight_Passenger_Link
- Flight_ID - Number
- Passenger_ID - Number
- Seat_Number - String

Passenger
- Passenger_ID - AutoNumber
- First_Name - String
- Last_Name - String

Helpful SQL:

//Get the flights
string sSQL = "SELECT Flight_ID, Flight_Number, Aircraft_Type FROM FLIGHT";


//Get the passengers for Flight ID 1
string sSQL = "SELECT PASSENGER.Passenger_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Seat_Number " +
              "FROM FLIGHT_PASSENGER_LINK, FLIGHT, PASSENGER " +
	      "WHERE FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_PASSENGER_LINK.FLIGHT_ID AND " +
	      "FLIGHT_PASSENGER_LINK.PASSENGER_ID = PASSENGER.PASSENGER_ID AND " +
	      "FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = 1"


//Updating seat numbers
string sSQL  = "UPDATE FLIGHT_PASSENGER_LINK " +
	       "SET Seat_Number = '5' " +
	       "WHERE FLIGHT_ID = 1 AND PASSENGER_ID = 2"

//Inserting a passenger
sSQL = "INSERT INTO PASSENGER(First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES('FirstName','LastName')";


//Insert into the link table
sSQL = "INSERT INTO Flight_Passenger_Link(Flight_ID, Passenger_ID, Seat_Number) " + 
       "VALUES( 1 , 6 , 3)";


//Deleting the link
string sSQL  = "Delete FROM FLIGHT_PASSENGER_LINK " +
	       "WHERE FLIGHT_ID = 1 AND " +
	       "PASSENGER_ID = 6";


//Delete the passenger
sSQL  = "Delete FROM PASSENGER " +
	"WHERE PASSENGER_ID = 6";


//To Insert a new passenger
   INSERT INTO PASSENGER(First_Name, Last_Name) VALUES('FirstName','LastName');

//Then you need to query back out the Passenger_ID by executing the statement:
//Get the passenger's ID
sSQL = "SELECT Passenger_ID from Passenger where First_Name = 'Shawn' AND Last_Name = 'Cowder'";
