Either book Visual C# 2010 How to Program, Deitel, Visual C# 2012 How to Program, Deitel or Visual C# How to program 6th edition will work for this course.

The book for this course is optional.  Some students find they are able to get by with using the Internet as their only resource.  This is up to you to purchase the book.  I teach from the book and my course follows the book, but many students get by without it.
